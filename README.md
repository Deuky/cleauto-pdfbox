This repository contains a simple placeholder project to demonstrate a multi-stage Dockerfile
based on Alpine and an accompanying Makefile with standard build targets.

## Files added

- `Dockerfile` – multi-stage build with `base`, `build`, `artifact` and `unit` stages.
- `Makefile` – targets for `configure`, `build`, `install`, and `start`.
